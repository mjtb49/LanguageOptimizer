# LanguageOptimizer
Hacked together mod for finding optimal languages for Minecraft speedrunning. The goal is to find search terms which, when used in the recipe book search bar, bring up useful items.

Collect some items, and then run /optimize to find optimal languages + strings for that inventory. 
Note that there is some unreliability due to hashing order, so for best results collect items in order you'd expect in real run and do not s+q in between. 
Finally, you can change the targeted items with /targetItems
